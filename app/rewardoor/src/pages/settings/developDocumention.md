To use callback feature, you need to create an app secret key using above configuration, and submit your callback url. The callback url should be a public url, and it should be able to receive `POST` request. The callback url will receive a `POST` request with content type `application/json`, and the body will be a json object with following format:

```json
{
    "evmAddress": "0x123abc",
    "credentialId": 123,
    "completeTime": 1632931200000
}
```

1. The `completeTime` is a timestamp in milliseconds, and it is the time when the credential is completed.
2. The `credentialId` is the id of the credential, it is the unique id of a credential.
3. The `evmAddress` is the address of the user's wallet, which is ETH compatible.

The request header will contains a `X-App-Sign` field, which is a signature of the request body. The signature is generated by using the app secret key. You can use the signature to verify the request body.

The signature is generated by following steps: 
1. Sort the request body by key, and concatenate the key and value with `=`, and concatenate the key-value pairs with `&`. For example, if the request body is `{"a": 1, "b": 2}`, then the sorted string will be `a=1&b=2`.
2. Append the app key to the end of the sorted string, and use md5 to hash the string. For example, if the app key is `123`, then the string will be `a=1&b=2&123`, and the hash value will be `md5("a=1&b=2&123")`.
